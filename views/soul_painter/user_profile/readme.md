# User Profile

- `profile.html` is the main page we have in this section. It contains information of players' id, username and game record.
- There are two types of record we have to show to the players in this page.
  - Score/Time record: It show the best socre/time this player gain in each mode. `multi_record.html` and `single_record.html` show the record of multiplayers mode and single mode respectively. (I'm not sure how to demonstrate the record in this two pages, so we may discuss this later.)
  - There are 7 buttons on the bottom of the user profile page. Each of them links to the vocabularies that the player has answered wrongly for 7 topics.(Same as above that we should discuss the content.) That is, each button will link to `topic$i.html`.
